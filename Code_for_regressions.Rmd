# Part 3: Regression models: predicting delays

After gaining an overview of the delay patterns by various factors, we wish to make predictions of delay times. We will be using linear regression models to predict mean delay times, and logistic regression models to predict the probablity of delay >= 15 minutes.

## Step 0: read in the dataset
```{r}
# read in dataset
library(plotly)
library(dplyr)
df <- read.csv("C:/Users/ziwan/Desktop/2018 Fall Courses/BST 260/Project/dataset/flight2017.csv")
```






## Step 1: Delay times as linear model: predict the mean delay times for each carrier / day of week / time of day

In this part, we are using linear models to predict mean delay times. Our predictors of interest are *carrier*, *days of week* and *time of day*, and we will be looking at them separately, both in the crude model and in the model incorporating these factors: (1) carrier, (2) month, (3) day of week, (4) distance of flight route, (5) time of day, and (6) region of departure.


```{r}

library(lsmeans)

# crude, predictor: carrier
delay.lm = lm(DEP_DELAY_NEW ~ OP_UNIQUE_CARRIER, data = df)
lsmeans(delay.lm, ~ OP_UNIQUE_CARRIER)

```
```{r}
# adjusted, predictor: carrier

df <- df %>%
   mutate(hour_cat = cut(DEP_TIME, breaks=c(-Inf, 600, 1200, 1800, Inf), labels=c("0 to 6","6 to 12","12 to 18", "18 to 24"))) %>%
   mutate(NORTHEAST = ifelse(ORIGIN_STATE_ABR %in% c("CT","ME", "MA", "NH","RI","VT","NJ","NY","PA"), "yes", "no")) %>%
   mutate(MIDWEST = ifelse(ORIGIN_STATE_ABR %in% c("IL","IN","MI","OH","WI","IA","KS","MN","MO","NE","ND","SD"), "yes", "no")) %>%
   mutate(SOUTH = ifelse(ORIGIN_STATE_ABR %in% c("DE","FL","GA","MD","NC","SC","VA","DC","WV","AL","KY","MS","TN","AR","LA","OK","TX"), "yes", "no")) %>%
   mutate(WEST = ifelse(ORIGIN_STATE_ABR %in% c("AZ","CO","ID","MT","NV","NM","UT","WY","AK","CA","HI","OR","WA"), "yes", "no")) %>%
   mutate(SPRING = ifelse(MONTH %in% c(3,4,5),"yes","no")) %>%
   mutate(SUMMER = ifelse(MONTH %in% c(6,7,8),"yes","no")) %>%
   mutate(FALL = ifelse(MONTH %in% c(9,10,11),"yes","no")) %>%
   mutate(WINTER = ifelse(MONTH %in% c(12,1,2),"yes","no"))

delay2.lm = lm(DEP_DELAY_NEW ~ OP_UNIQUE_CARRIER + MONTH + factor(DAY_OF_WEEK) + DISTANCE + hour_cat + NORTHEAST + MIDWEST + SOUTH + WEST, data = df)

summary(delay2.lm)

lsmeans(delay2.lm, ~ OP_UNIQUE_CARRIER )
   
          
```

We summarized the above results into the table below:
![Table 1](C:\Users\ziwan\Desktop\2018 Fall Courses\BST 260\Project\bst260-airlinedelays\Table 1.PNG)

From the adjusted predicted mean delay times for each carrier, we see that when assuming all other factors are on average, Hawaiian Airline in general has the shortest predicted delay time, followed by Alaska Airline, American Airline and Delta Airline; and in general JetBlue Airline has the longest predicted delay times.




```{r}
# crude, predictor: day of week
delay_day.lm = lm(DEP_DELAY_NEW ~ factor(DAY_OF_WEEK), data = df)
lsmeans(delay_day.lm, ~ DAY_OF_WEEK)
```
```{r}
# adjusted, predictor: day of week
lsmeans(delay2.lm, ~ DAY_OF_WEEK )
```

We summarized the above results into the table below:
![Table 2](C:\Users\ziwan\Desktop\2018 Fall Courses\BST 260\Project\bst260-airlinedelays\Table 2.PNG)

From the adjusted predicted mean delay times by each day of week, we that that when assuming all other factors are on average, going on a flight on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Saturday would generally have shorter delay times, while leaving on Friday would probably lead to longer delay.


```{r}
# adjusted, predictor: time of day
lsmeans(delay2.lm, ~ hour_cat )
```

We summarized the above results into the table below:
![Table 3](C:\Users\ziwan\Desktop\2018 Fall Courses\BST 260\Project\bst260-airlinedelays\Table 3.PNG)
From the adjusted model, we see that when assuming all other factors are on average, going on a flight at in the morning (6:00 to 12:00) would generally have shorter delay times, while leaving at night (18:00 to 24:00) would likely result in longer delay.


```{r}
# stratification
# predictor: carrier
# stratified by day of week

lsmeans(delay2.lm, ~ OP_UNIQUE_CARRIER*DAY_OF_WEEK )
```

We summarized the above results (stratified by day of week) into the table below:
![Table 4](C:\Users\ziwan\Desktop\2018 Fall Courses\BST 260\Project\bst260-airlinedelays\Table 4.PNG)
We see that similar to our previous findings, on average the delay times on Tuesdays are the shortest, and on Tuesday the carrier with the shortest predicted delay is Hawaiian Airline. Likewise, the predicted delay times for Fridays are the highest, and on Friday the carrier with the longest predicted delay is JetBlue. So probably not a good idea to leave on Friday on a JetBlue flight!


```{r}
# stratification
# predictor: carrier
# stratified by time of day

lsmeans(delay2.lm, ~ OP_UNIQUE_CARRIER*hour_cat )
```

We summarized the above results (stratified by time of day) into the table below:
![Table 5](C:\Users\ziwan\Desktop\2018 Fall Courses\BST 260\Project\bst260-airlinedelays\Table 5.PNG)
We see that similar to our previous findings, on average the delay times when leaving between 6:00 to 12:00 in the morning are the shortest, and at that time period the carrier with the shortest predicted delay is still Hawaiian Airline. Likewise, the predicted delay times for 18:00 to 24:00 are the highest, and at that time period the carrier with the longest predicted delay is still JetBlue. 




Since weather could impact delays, and weather patterns are often related to seasons, we also wish stratify by season to see if there are any differences:

```{r}
# stratification
# predictor: carrier
# stratified by season

# Spring
Spring <- df %>%
  filter (SPRING=="yes")

delay_spring.lm = lm(DEP_DELAY_NEW ~ OP_UNIQUE_CARRIER + MONTH + factor(DAY_OF_WEEK) + DISTANCE + hour_cat + NORTHEAST + MIDWEST + SOUTH + WEST, data = Spring)

summary(delay_spring.lm)

lsmeans(delay_spring.lm, ~ OP_UNIQUE_CARRIER )

```
```{r}
# Summer
Summer <- df %>%
  filter (SUMMER=="yes")

delay_summer.lm = lm(DEP_DELAY_NEW ~ OP_UNIQUE_CARRIER + MONTH + factor(DAY_OF_WEEK) + DISTANCE + hour_cat + NORTHEAST + MIDWEST + SOUTH + WEST, data = Summer)

summary(delay_summer.lm)

lsmeans(delay_summer.lm, ~ OP_UNIQUE_CARRIER )
```
```{r}
# Fall
Fall <- df %>%
  filter (FALL=="yes")

delay_fall.lm = lm(DEP_DELAY_NEW ~ OP_UNIQUE_CARRIER + MONTH + factor(DAY_OF_WEEK) + DISTANCE + hour_cat + NORTHEAST + MIDWEST + SOUTH + WEST, data = Fall)

summary(delay_fall.lm)

lsmeans(delay_fall.lm, ~ OP_UNIQUE_CARRIER )
```
```{r}
# release some memory
rm(Spring)
rm(Summer)
rm(Fall)
```


```{r}
# Winter
Winter <- df %>%
  filter (WINTER=="yes")

delay_winter.lm = lm(DEP_DELAY_NEW ~ OP_UNIQUE_CARRIER + MONTH + factor(DAY_OF_WEEK) + DISTANCE + hour_cat + NORTHEAST + MIDWEST + SOUTH + WEST, data = Winter)

summary(delay_winter.lm)

lsmeans(delay_winter.lm, ~ OP_UNIQUE_CARRIER )
```
```{r}
# release some memory
rm(delay.lm)
rm(delay_day.lm)
rm(delay_fall.lm)
rm(delay_hour.lm)
rm(delay_spring.lm)
rm(delay_summer.lm)
rm(delay_winter.lm)
rm(delay2.lm)
rm(Winter)
```

We summarized the above results (stratified by season) into the table below:
![Table 6](C:\Users\ziwan\Desktop\2018 Fall Courses\BST 260\Project\bst260-airlinedelays\Table 6.PNG)

We first see that in general, delays are much shorter during Fall for all carriers. Overall, Hawaiian Airline still show the shortest predicted delays for most seasons (except during Winter, where Alaska seems to be doing better). JetBlue has the longest delay time during Summer. In other seasons, some other carriers seem to have longer predicted delays than JetBlue.




## Step 2: Delay times as logistic model: predict odds of delaying 15+ minutes (compared to no delay or delaying less than 15 minutes) for each carrier (stratified by season)

Since there might be extreme values in the delay times, we also wish to dichotimize delays into a binary variable (delaying 15+ minutes vs. delaying < 15 minutes or no delay) and see how these carriers perform, using logistic regression models:

```{r}

# predictor: carrier (adjusted)
# Spring
Spring <- df %>%
  filter (SPRING=="yes")

logit_model <- glm(DEP_DEL15 ~ OP_UNIQUE_CARRIER + MONTH + factor(DAY_OF_WEEK) + DISTANCE + hour_cat + NORTHEAST + MIDWEST + SOUTH + WEST, data=Spring, family = "binomial")
summary(logit_model)
exp(coef(logit_model))


```
```{r}
# predictor: carrier (adjusted)
# Summer
rm(Spring)
Summer <- df %>%
  filter (SUMMER=="yes")

logit_model <- glm(DEP_DEL15 ~ OP_UNIQUE_CARRIER + MONTH + factor(DAY_OF_WEEK) + DISTANCE + hour_cat + NORTHEAST + MIDWEST + SOUTH + WEST, data=Summer, family = "binomial")
summary(logit_model)
exp(coef(logit_model))
```
```{r}
# predictor: carrier (adjusted)
# Fall
rm(Summer)
Fall <- df %>%
  filter (FALL=="yes")

logit_model <- glm(DEP_DEL15 ~ OP_UNIQUE_CARRIER + MONTH + factor(DAY_OF_WEEK) + DISTANCE + hour_cat + NORTHEAST + MIDWEST + SOUTH + WEST, data=Fall, family = "binomial")
summary(logit_model)
exp(coef(logit_model))
```
```{r}
# predictor: carrier (adjusted)
# Winter
rm(Fall)
Winter <- df %>%
  filter (WINTER=="yes")

logit_model <- glm(DEP_DEL15 ~ OP_UNIQUE_CARRIER + MONTH + factor(DAY_OF_WEEK) + DISTANCE + hour_cat + NORTHEAST + MIDWEST + SOUTH + WEST, data=Winter, family = "binomial")
summary(logit_model)
exp(coef(logit_model))
```

We summarized the results (stratified by season) for logistic regressions into the table below:
![Table 6](C:\Users\ziwan\Desktop\2018 Fall Courses\BST 260\Project\bst260-airlinedelays\Table 6.PNG)

Similar to findings in the linear regressions results, here we also see that when compared to American Airline, the odds of delaying 15+ minutes for Hawaiian Airline is the lowest across all seasons, and the odds of delaying 15+ minutes is highest among either JetBlue or Virgin America (Depending on seasons).
